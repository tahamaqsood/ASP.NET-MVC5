DisplayName:
============

=> When you use the @Html.LabelFor() helper method in a strongly typed view,
the method displays a label with a text whose value is corresponding to the
property name.


=> By using "DisplayName" Data Annotation you can explicitly state the text
which will display on your web browser.


=> Before using this [DisplayName] annotation, you need to add namespace
which is  " using System.ComponentModel; "


Note: 
=> using System.ComponentModel;

=> using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

Are two different namespaces, supports different functionalities.


-------
Syntax:
-------

[DisplayName("Label Name Which you want to display on your Web browser")]

Note: If you use this Annotation then your Strongly Typed Helper Method
@Html.LabelFor() will not work.


-------------------------
Practical Implementation:
-------------------------

    public class Employees
    {
        //ID
        [DisplayName("ID")]
        public int EmployeeId { get; set; }

        //Name
        [DisplayName("Name")]
        public string EmployeeName { get; set; }   
    }

* Now, if you run your project, you will see ID and Name as a label on your TextBoxes.
