        <p id="para">
            The 2020 redesign puts the Corolla on a new platform shared with the compact sedan’s hatchback sibling.
            Power comes from a standard 139-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission.
            A more-powerful 2.0-liter four-cylinder is also available.
            All Corolla trim levels have an independent rear suspension for better handling,
            and Toyota’s Safety Sense 2.0 suite of safety and driver-assistance features is standard.

        </p>
        <p id="para2">
            The 2014 redesign improved aerodynamics, with a stiffened body that used more high-strength steel.
            A continuously variable automatic transmission was introduced.
            A new LE Eco version with a more elaborate variable valve timing system offered more power and better fuel economy.
            More rigid suspension pieces improved handling. Other than special editions, not much changed until 2017’s sportier grille and LED headlights,
            along with a standard backup camera and upgraded fabrics.
